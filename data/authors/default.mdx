With over 3 years of experience as a DevOps Specialist at Solita, I am passionate about delivering IT solutions that are scalable, secure, and efficient. I have a strong expertise in AWS and public cloud governance, ensuring compliance and optimal resource utilization across multiple projects and clients.

I also excel at creating and managing infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like AWS CDK and CloudFormation, streamlining resource provisioning and managing landing zones. Additionally, I contribute to the development and maintenance of our CI/CD pipelines, leveraging AWS services such as CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline. My goal is to continuously learn, innovate, and collaborate with my team and stakeholders, while providing high-quality IT services that meet the evolving needs of the market.
